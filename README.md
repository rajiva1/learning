kids-math.py is a program designed to help kids practice with basic math type - Addition, Substraction, Multiplication and Division. 

By default, the program asks 3 x 10 questions per type (e.g. Addition, Substraction) and keeps track of time taken per question and overall. At the beginning, the program checks the previous performance and prints encouraging messge. At the end, the program gives the overall summary and then sends an email as well.

The score/time/date etc. are stored in SQL DB with reasonable granularity.
